  abstract    = {Given data, finding a faithful low-dimensional hyperbolic embedding of the data is a key method by which we can extract hierarchical information or learn representative geometric features of the data. In this paper, we explore a new method for learning hyperbolic representations by taking a metric-first approach. Rather than determining the low-dimensional hyperbolic embedding directly, we learn a tree structure on the data. This tree structure can then be used directly to extract hierarchical information, embedded into a hyperbolic manifold using Sarkar's construction {\textbackslash}cite\{sarkar\}, or used as a tree approximation of the original metric. To this end, we present a novel fast algorithm {\textbackslash}textsc\{{TreeRep}\} such that, given a \${\textbackslash}delta\$-hyperbolic metric (for any \${\textbackslash}delta {\textbackslash}geq 0\$), the algorithm learns a tree structure that approximates the original metric. In the case when \${\textbackslash}delta = 0\$, we show analytically that {\textbackslash}textsc\{{TreeRep}\} exactly recovers the original tree structure. We show empirically that {\textbackslash}textsc\{{TreeRep}\} is not only many orders of magnitude faster than previously known algorithms, but also produces metrics with lower average distortion and higher mean average precision than most previous algorithms for learning hyperbolic embeddings, extracting hierarchical information, and approximating metrics via tree metrics.},

Mathematically, the {GraphBLAS} defines a core set of matrix-based graph operations that can be used to implement a wide class of graph algorithms in a wide range of programming environments. This paper provides an introduction to the mathematics of the {GraphBLAS}. Graphs represent connections between vertices with edges. Matrices can represent a wide range of graphs using adjacency matrices or incidence matrices. Adjacency matrices are often easier to analyze while incidence matrices are often better for representing data. Fortunately, the two are easily connected by matrix multiplication. A key feature of matrix mathematics is that a very small number of matrix operations can be used to manipulate a very wide range of graphs. This composability of a small number of operations is the foundation of the {GraphBLAS}. A standard such as the {GraphBLAS} can only be effective if it has low performance overhead. Performance measurements of prototype {GraphBLAS} implementations indicate that the overhead is low.},

Many polyadic interactions are asymmetric, with nodes playing distinctive roles. In an academic collaboration network, for example, the order of authors on a paper often reflects the nature of their contributions to the completed work. To model these networks, we introduce annotated hypergraphs as natural polyadic generalizations of directed graphs. Annotated hypergraphs form a highly general framework for incorporating metadata into polyadic graph models. To facilitate data analysis with annotated hypergraphs, we construct a role-aware configuration null model for these structures and prove an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme for sampling from it. We proceed to formulate several metrics and algorithms for the analysis of annotated hypergraphs. Several of these, such as assortativity and modularity, naturally generalize dyadic counterparts. Other metrics, such as local role densities, are unique to the setting of annotated hypergraphs. We illustrate our techniques on six digital social networks, and present a detailed case-study of the Enron email data set.},

  abstract     = {Complex systems, composed at the most basic level of units and their interactions, describe phenomena in a wide variety of domains, from neuroscience to computer science and economics. The wide variety of applications has resulted in two key challenges: the generation of many domain-specific strategies for complex systems analyses that are seldom revisited, and the compartmentalization of representation and analysis ideas within a domain due to inconsistency in complex systems language. In this work we propose basic, domain-agnostic language in order to advance toward a more cohesive vocabulary. We use this language to evaluate each step of the complex systems analysis pipeline, beginning with the system under study and data collected, then moving through different mathematical frameworks for encoding the observed data (i.e., graphs, simplicial complexes, and hypergraphs), and relevant computational methods for each framework. At each step we consider different types of dependencies; these are properties of the system that describe how the existence of an interaction among a set of units in a system may affect the possibility of the existence of another relation. We discuss how dependencies may arise and how they may alter the interpretation of results or the entirety of the analysis pipeline. We close with two real-world examples using coauthorship data and email communications data that illustrate how the system under study, the dependencies therein, the research question, and the choice of mathematical representation influence the results. We hope this work can serve as an opportunity for reflection for experienced complex systems scientists, as well as an introductory resource for new researchers.},

  abstract   = {Similarity-based Hierarchical Clustering ({HC}) is a classical unsupervised machine learning algorithm that has traditionally been solved with heuristic algorithms like Average-Linkage. Recently, Dasgupta reframed {HC} as a discrete optimization problem by introducing a global cost function measuring the quality of a given tree. In this work, we provide the first continuous relaxation of Dasgupta's discrete optimization problem with provable quality guarantees. The key idea of our method, {HypHC}, is showing a direct correspondence from discrete trees to continuous representations (via the hyperbolic embeddings of their leaf nodes) and back (via a decoding algorithm that maps leaf embeddings to a dendrogram), allowing us to search the space of discrete binary trees with continuous optimization. Building on analogies between trees and hyperbolic space, we derive a continuous analogue for the notion of lowest common ancestor, which leads to a continuous relaxation of Dasgupta's discrete objective. We can show that after decoding, the global minimizer of our continuous relaxation yields a discrete tree with a (1+eps)-factor approximation for Dasgupta's optimal tree, where eps can be made arbitrarily small and controls optimization challenges. We experimentally evaluate {HypHC} on a variety of {HC} benchmarks and find that even approximate solutions found with gradient descent have superior clustering quality than agglomerative heuristics or other gradient based algorithms. Finally, we highlight the flexibility of {HypHC} using end-to-end training in a downstream classification task.},

In order to compute a hyperbolic embedding from comparison or similarity information, one has to solve a hyperbolic distance geometry problem. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to compute hyperbolic embeddings from an arbitrary mix of noisy metric and non-metric data. Our algorithms are based on semidefinite programming and the notion of a hyperbolic distance matrix, in many ways parallel to its famous Euclidean counterpart. A central ingredient we put forward is a semidefinite characterization of the hyperbolic Gramian---a matrix of Lorentzian inner products. This characterization allows us to formulate a semidefinite relaxation to efficiently compute hyperbolic embeddings in two stages: first, we complete and denoise the observed hyperbolic distance matrix; second, we propose a spectral factorization method to estimate the embedded points from the hyperbolic distance matrix. We show through numerical experiments how the flexibility to mix metric and non-metric constraints allows us to efficiently compute embeddings from arbitrary data.},

We compare the performance of popular kernels with several baseline methods and study the effect of applying a Gaussian {RBF} kernel to the metric induced by a graph kernel. In doing so, we find that simple baselines become competitive after this transformation on some datasets.

  abstract   = {In order to solve the problem of the traditional image matching algorithm based on the spectral feature, the spectral matching algorithm based on hyperbolic mahalanobis metric is proposed in this paper. The algorithm first introduces a hyperbolic metric that has better adaptability to the sample data. And the hyperbolic mahalanobis metric is defined according to the statistical properties of the data. For a point in a given pointset, the sub point-set is selected according to the hyperbolic mahalanobis metric and the weighted graph of the sub point-set is constructed. The eigenvalue vector and the spectral gap vector are obtained by the singular value decomposition ({SVD}) of the adjacency matrix of the weighted graph, which construct the hyperbolic mahalanobis metric spectral feature. Finally, the matching matrix is constructed based on the similarity between the hyperbolic mahalanobis metric spectral feature and geometric relations between feature points. Thereby establish the matching mathematical model and introduce the greedy algorithm to obtain the matching results. A large number of experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves the matching accuracy and the robustness. And the algorithm extends the application range of the spectral matching algorithm.},

@Thesis{Sonthalia2021,
  abstract     = {All data has some inherent mathematical structure. I am interested in understanding the intrinsic geometric and probabilistic structure of data to design effective algorithms and tools that can be applied to machine learning and across all branches of science.

The focus of this thesis is to increase the effectiveness of machine learning techniques by developing a mathematical and algorithmic framework using which, given any type of data, we can learn an optimal representation. Representation learning is done for many reasons. It could be done to fix the corruption given corrupted data or to learn a low dimensional or simpler representation, given high dimensional data or a very complex representation of the data. It could also be that the current representation of the data does not capture the important geometric features of the data.

One of the many challenges in representation learning is determining ways to judge the quality of the representation learned. In many cases, the consensus is that if d is the natural metric on the representation, then this metric should provide meaningful information about the data. Many examples of this can be seen in areas such as metric learning, manifold learning, and graph embedding. However, most algorithms that solve these problems learn a representation in a metric space first and then extract a metric.

A large part of my research is exploring what happens if the order is switched, that is, learn the appropriate metric first and the embedding later. The philosophy behind this approach is that understanding the inherent geometry of the data is the most crucial part of representation learning. Often, studying the properties of the appropriate metric on the input data sets indicates the type of space, we should be seeking for the representation. Hence giving us more robust representations. Optimizing for the appropriate metric can also help overcome issues such as missing and noisy data. My projects fall into three different areas of representation learning.

1)  Geometric and probabilistic analysis of representation learning methods.
2) Developing methods to learn optimal metrics on large datasets.
3) Applications.

For the category of geometric and probabilistic analysis of representation learning methods, we have three projects. First, designing optimal training data for denoising autoencoders. Second, formulating a new optimal transport problem and understanding the geometric structure. Third, analyzing the robustness to perturbations of the solutions obtained from the classical multidimensional scaling algorithm versus that of the true solutions to the multidimensional scaling problem.

For learning optimal metric, we are given a dissimilarity matrix \$hat\{D\}\$, some function \$f\$ and some a subset \$S\$ of the space of all metrics and we want to find \$D in S\$ that minimizes \$f(D,hat\{D\})\$. In this thesis, we consider the version of the problem when \$S\$ is the space of metrics defined on a fixed graph. That is, given a graph \$G\$, we let \$S\$, be the space of all metrics defined via \$G\$. For this \$S\$, we consider the sparse objective function as well as convex objective functions. We also looked at the problem where we want to learn a tree. We also show how the ideas behind learning the optimal metric can be applied to dimensionality reduction in the presence of missing data.

Finally, we look at an application to real world data. Specifically trying to reconstruct ancient Greek text.},

Particularly, a weighted tree can be embedded such that the weight on each edge is realized as the hyperbolic distance between its embedded vertices. Thus the embedding preserves the metric information of the tree along with its topology. The distance distortion between non adjacent vertices can be made arbitrarily small ‚Äì less than a (1‚Äâ+‚ÄâŒµ) factor for any given Œµ. Existing results on low distortion of embedding discrete metrics into trees carry over to hyperbolic metric through this result.

But what does this bode for the convergence of global culture? Here we explore the relationship between centralization in social networks and contraction or collapse in the diversity of semantic expressions such as ideas, opinions and tastes. We advance formal examination of this relationship by introducing new methods of manifold learning that allow us to map social networks and semantic combinations into comparable hyperbolic spaces. Hyperbolic representations natively represent both hierarchy and diversity within a system. In a Poincar√© disk‚Äîa two-dimensional hyperbolic embedding‚Äîradius from center traces the position of an actor in a social hierarchy or an idea in a semantic hierarchy. Angle of the disk required to inscribe connected actors or ideas captures their diversity. We illustrate this method by examining the relationship between social centralization and semantic diversity within 21st Century physics, empirically demonstrating how dense, centralized collaboration is associated with a reduction in the space of ideas and how these patterns generalize to all modern scholarship and science. We discuss the complex of causes underlying this association, and theorize the dynamic interplay between structural centralization and semantic contraction, arguing that it introduces an essential tension between the supply and demand of difference.},

A lean algebraic multigrid ({LAMG}) solver of the symmetric linear system \$Ax=b\$ is presented, where \$A\$ is a graph Laplacian. {LAMG}'s run time and storage are empirically demonstrated to scale linearly with the number of edges. {LAMG} consists of a setup phase, during which a sequence of increasingly coarser Laplacian systems is constructed, and an iterative solve phase using multigrid cycles. General graphs pose algorithmic challenges not encountered in traditional multigrid applications. {LAMG} combines a lean piecewise-constant interpolation, judicious node aggregation based on a new node proximity measure (the affinity), and an energy correction of coarse-level systems. This results in fast convergence and substantial setup and memory savings. A serial {LAMG} implementation scaled linearly for a diverse set of 3774 real-world graphs with up to 47 million edges, with no parameter tuning. {LAMG} was more robust than the {UMFPACK} direct solver and combinatorial multigrid ({CMG}), although {CMG} was faster than {LAMG} on average. Our methodology is extensible to eigenproblems and other graph computations.},

With the increased popularity of grounded theory, many researchers have sought to use ever-increasingly large datasets to analyze and draw patterns about social dynamics. However, the data is simply too big to enable a single human to derive effective models for many complex social phenomena. Computational methods offer a unique opportunity to analyze a wide spectrum of sociological events by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence. Within the human factors community, machine learning has emerged as the dominant {AI}-approach to deal with big data. However, along with its many benefits, machine learning has introduced a unique challenge: interpretability. The models of macro-social behavior generated by {AI} are so complex that rarely can they translated into human understanding. We propose a new method to conduct grounded theory research by leveraging the power of machine learning to analyze complex social phenomena through social network analysis while retaining interpretability as a core feature.},

This issue arises prominently in automated behavior analysis, in which agent movements or actions of interest are detected from video tracking data. To reduce annotation effort, we present {TREBA}: a method to learn annotation-sample efficient trajectory embedding for behavior analysis, based on multi-task self-supervised learning. The tasks in our method can be efficiently engineered by domain experts through a process we call "task programming", which uses programs to explicitly encode structured knowledge from domain experts. Total domain expert effort can be reduced by exchanging data annotation time for the construction of a small number of programmed tasks. We evaluate this trade-off using data from behavioral neuroscience, in which specialized domain knowledge is used to identify behaviors. We present experimental results in three datasets across two domains: mice and fruit flies. Using embeddings from {TREBA}, we reduce annotation burden by up to a factor of 10 without compromising accuracy compared to state-of-the-art features. Our results thus suggest that task programming and self-supervision can be an effective way to reduce annotation effort for domain experts.},

Thus, the importance of phylogenetic methods is increasingly being recognized, and the development of a novel phylogenetic approach can contribute to several areas of research. Recently, the use of hyperbolic geometry has attracted attention in artificial intelligence research. Hyperbolic space can better represent a hierarchical structure compared to Euclidean space, and can therefore be useful for describing and analyzing a phylogenetic tree. In this study, we developed a novel metric that considers the characteristics of a phylogenetic tree for representation in hyperbolic space. We compared the performance of the proposed hyperbolic embeddings, general hyperbolic embeddings, and Euclidean embeddings, and confirmed that our method could be used to more precisely reconstruct evolutionary distance. We also demonstrate that our approach is useful for predicting the nearest-neighbor node in a partial phylogenetic tree with missing nodes. Furthermore, we proposed a novel approach based on our metric to integrate multiple trees for analyzing tree nodes or imputing missing distances. This study highlights the utility of adopting a geometric approach for further advancing the applications of phylogenetic methods.},

Vertex sequence-based embedding procedures use features extracted from linear sequences of nodes to create embeddings using a neural network. In this paper, we propose diffusion graphs as a method to rapidly generate vertex sequences for network embedding. Its computational efficiency is superior to previous methods due to simpler sequence generation, and it produces more accurate results. In experiments, we found that the performance relative to other methods improves with increasing edge density in the graph. In a community detection task, clustering nodes in the embedding space produces better results compared to other sequence-based embedding methods.},

In this paper, we present that the formulation of {MLDA} can be equivalently casted as a new least-squares framework so as to significantly mitigate the computational overhead and scale to the data collections with higher dimension. Further, it is also found that appealing regularization techniques can be incorporated into the least-squares model to boost generalization accuracy. Experimental results on several popular multi-label benchmarks not only verify the established equivalence relationship, but also corroborate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.},

Covariance matrix of this distribution is well known to be identical to its multinomial counterpart multiplied by 1-(n-1)/(N-1), with N and n being population and sample sizes, respectively. It appears to however, have been less discussed in the literature about the meaning of this relationship, especially regarding the specific form of the multiplier. Based on an augmenting argument together with probabilistic symmetry, we present a more transparent understanding for the covariance structure of the multivariate hypergeometric distribution. We discuss implications of these combined techniques and provide a unified description about the relative efficiency for estimating population mean based on simple random sampling, probability proportional-to-size sampling and adaptive cluster sampling, with versus without replacement. We also provide insight into the classic random group method for variance estimation.},

These subset sizes are rarely explicitly learned - be it the cluster sizes in clustering applications or the number of shared versus independent generative latent factors in weakly-supervised learning. Probability distributions over correct combinations of subset sizes are non-differentiable due to hard constraints, which prohibit gradient-based optimization. In this work, we propose the differentiable hypergeometric distribution. The hypergeometric distribution models the probability of different group sizes based on their relative importance. We introduce reparameterizable gradients to learn the importance between groups and highlight the advantage of explicitly learning the size of subsets in two typical applications: weakly-supervised learning and clustering. In both applications, we outperform previous approaches, which rely on suboptimal heuristics to model the unknown size of groups.},

@Report{Luxburg2011,
  abstract    = {Next to the shortest path distance, the second most popular distance function between vertices in a graph is the commute distance (resistance distance). For two vertices u and v, the hitting time H\_\{uv\} is the expected time it takes a random walk to travel from u to v. The commute time is its symmetrized version C\_\{uv\} = H\_\{uv\} + H\_\{vu\}. In our paper we study the behavior of hitting times and commute distances when the number n of vertices in the graph is very large. We prove that as n converges to infinty, hitting times and commute distances converge to expressions that do not take into account the global structure of the graph at all. Namely, the hitting time H\_\{uv\} converges to 1/d\_v and the commute time to 1/d\_u + 1/d\_v where d\_u and d\_v denote the degrees of vertices u and v. In these cases, the hitting and commute times are misleading in the sense that they do not provide information about the structure of the graph. We focus on two major classes of random graphs: random geometric graphs (k-nearest neighbor graphs, epsilon-graphs, Gaussian similarity graphs) and random graphs with given expected degrees (in particular, Erdos-Renyi graphs with and without planted partitions)},

They provide compact representations that encapsulate word similarity and attain state-of-the-art performance in a range of linguistic tasks. The success of neural embeddings has prompted significant amounts of research into applications in domains other than language. One such domain is graph-structured data, where embeddings of vertices can be learned that encapsulate vertex similarity and improve performance on tasks including edge prediction and vertex labelling. For both {NLP} and graph based tasks, embeddings have been learned in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. However, recent work has shown that the appropriate isometric space for embedding complex networks is not the flat Euclidean space, but negatively curved, hyperbolic space. We present a new concept that exploits these recent insights and propose learning neural embeddings of graphs in hyperbolic space. We provide experimental evidence that embedding graphs in their natural geometry significantly improves performance on downstream tasks for several real-world public datasets.},

Research on active learning in text classification has so far concentrated on single-label classification; active learning for multi-label classification, instead, has either been tackled in a simulated (and, we contend, non-realistic) way, or neglected tout court. In this paper we aim to fill this gap by examining a number of realistic strategies for tackling active learning for multi-label classification. Each such strategy consists of a rule for combining the outputs returned by the individual binary classifiers as a result of classifying a given unlabeled document. We present the results of extensive experiments in which we test these strategies on two standard text classification datasets.},
