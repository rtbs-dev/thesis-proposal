# Thesis Proposal 
White paper and presentation. 

## Directory 

- Proposal White-paper [md](proposal.md)/[pdf](proposal.pdf)/[settings-yaml](proposal-settings.yaml)
- presentation (still placeholder!)
- bibliography (still just .bib, but _SORTED BY PRIORITY_ :smile:) [.bib](resources/biblio.bib)


## Contributing? 
If you're assisting/co-authoring anything, this is how: 

### edits
make the changes in a branch, and submit a PR for discussion purposes. 

### comments
- If they are simultaneous with edits, use the PR page and in-code commenting. 
- Otherwise, open an issue with high-level notes, and reference files/etc. from there. 
  _THEN_ the changes will get done using the #[edits] process above, so that low-level comments get addressed in-context via PR.
