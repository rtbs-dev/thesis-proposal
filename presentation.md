:::

How is data used by and impacting people? How can we do better?


## Long-term


::: {.alert title="EL's Strengths"} :::
Expertise in the AI/ML space is so often tied to _implementation within our domain_. 
Perfect to encourage a culture of bundling case studies (data+code) and _sharing_ them. 
:::

- What "roles" are available to champion DataOps within teams? (Information Maintainers?)
- Reducing pain points (e.g. in data flows, server security, project management) with user-studies... what tasks are we "needing to do" and how can we amortize the cost?
- Build a community culture around documenting and sharing our solutions to save time and preserve institutional know-how.

### DataOps

- Richard McElreath's talk on Reproducibility in the Sciences, [Science as Amateur Software Development](https://youtu.be/zwRdO9_GGhY)
- Comparing data version control tools: [blogpost](https://dagshub.com/blog/data-version-control-tools/)
- Git for Science ([PlosONE](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668) paper and [repository](https://github.com/jdblischak/git-for-science))

### Documentation

- Example: AI-CoI's new web-based [Catalog of AI Projects](https://aicoi.ipages.nist.gov/ai-catalog/) \@NIST, and the [gitlab repository](https://gitlab.nist.gov/aicoi/ai-catalog/) we make it with
- Authoring scholarly papers with modern tools: [Manubot](https://manubot.org/)
- Turn Jupyter notebooks into beautiful websites and documents: [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) (then, host them easily on GitLab)
- _This presentation is a [gitlab repository](https://gitlab.nist.gov/gitlab/kea/templates/presentation)!_ I took care of NIST logo compliance so you don't have to `:)`
